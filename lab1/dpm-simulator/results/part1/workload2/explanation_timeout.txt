Higher timeout values lead to lower transitions.
Timeout is the amount of time the psm machine stays in the "running" state. Consecutive workloads item, having starting time inside the timeout value,
force the psm to stay in the run state and now go to idle.
Lower timeout values in turns force higher transitions: as soon as the workload item is done, psm switches to idle mode (t=0) and is woken when a new workload is detected.
